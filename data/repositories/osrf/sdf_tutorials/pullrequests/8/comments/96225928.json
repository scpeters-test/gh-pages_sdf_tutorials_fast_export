A lil note from me.

So this convention help us internally when reading code that has to do with the actual tree structure. Again, users should not think in terms of trees when writing an SDF, but if it so happens that your SDF describes something simple like a chain, it\u2019s not that bad making that analogy.   \nThat\u2019s it, my 2 cents.
